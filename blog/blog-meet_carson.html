                    Hello! Welcome to my page. Here, I showcase my achievements as a Software Engineer, the things
                    I have learned from my individual projects, as well as some career information about me. Growing up,
                    I was fascinated by technology and desired to learn more. I decided to venture into programming when
                    I was 14 years old playing a game called Garry's Mod. There, I learned my first programming language, Lua.
                    Since then, I was hooked on development in it's entirety and eventually tried different languages.<br>
                      <br>
                    I have been a developer for several gaming communities to include communities on Garry's Mod, FiveM/RedM,
                    Arma 3, to where I am now, outside from games, working with the State of Alaska. In my day to day,
                    I develope, test, and maintain network systems, computing systems, and programs written by me.<br>
                      <br>
                    Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or send me an email if you'd like to learn more, or are 
                    interested in having me work with you!
