                    Hey There! It's been awhile since I wrote a blog post. Things havbe been pretty busy for me as of
                    recent. I've been plugging away on my education, taking on being a new dad and celebrating my first
                    Father's Day as a new dad. Life has been pretty crazy. To keep you somewhat in the loop of my growth
                    as a developer, here is what all has happened the last few months:<br><br>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I interviewed for my 1st Software Enngineer Position</li>
                        <li>I earned my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification</li>
                        <li>I started working as a freelance developer for a FiveM Community</li>
                    </ul><br>

                    On top of that, I also have been working with a new keyboard, the ErgoDox EZ. It's a pretty wild keyboard to me,
                    considering it has a split center. So far, it's been a fairly enjoyable experience, but troublesome, especially with
                    the ortholinear layout compared to the traditional staggered. Otherwise, <em>No More Wrist Pain!</em><br><br>
